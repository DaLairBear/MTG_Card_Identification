# MTG_Card_Identification

The premise of this project will be to design a Machine Learning Programing that recognizes 
a Magic the Gathering card based off 3 criterion: Card Name Text, Set Symbol, Card Art.

The first step needed will to be pre_precessing such as image resizing and normalizing to account for lighting/angled capture.
Secondly to define and The Segmentaion areas based on the Card Name Text possible Fields, the Set Symbol locations and finally the art field.

I know there are many steps to come but this is my general baseline of thought before diving into this project.
